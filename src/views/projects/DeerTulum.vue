            <h2>
              Deer Tulum is a lifestyle brand showcasing creatives and master
              artisans, offering beautiful home goods while helping communities
              of artists thrive. The brand embraces the mysticism that defines
              Mexico and especially Tulum.:
            </h2>
            <p>
              We helped Deer Tulum revisit the existing brand architecture and
              launch a new online ecosystem. We developed a Shopify store that
              will be the home of Deer Tulum online echoing their stores that
              are experiential, merging community, workspace &amp; learning,
              bringing the dreamy boho-chic lifestyle of Tulum to the World.
            </p>
            <p>
              In parallel we work with Deer Tulum to create a strong social
              media presence, leveraging its power to boost influence and
              attract new customers. Another key element in creating a thriving
              omnichannel offer is developing strong e-mail marketing campaigns
              and building robust e-mail lists. Through well-planned promotions
              and automations. Through our weekly newsletters, we&apos;ll
              continue to generate brand advocates thanks to strong and relevant
              content.
            </p>
            <p>
              To top off this initial strategy a series of targeted promotional
              campaigns will run on Instagram, Facebook &amp; Pinterest, with a
              targeted and goal-oriented methodology. This will direct traffic
              to our website where a newsletter sign-up form will populate our
              database and a blog section featuring a unique and engaging image
              and video content, thus Deer Tulum not only becomes a destination
              for curated lifestyle products but also a trusted source for
              content that enriches our followers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, we are tasked with creating a stellar pitch deck, one
              that goes beyond summarizing and that truly captures the attention
              of investors, imbuing the deck with the spirit of the unique
              market proposition that is Deer Tulum.

                Transitioning from brick &amp; mortar to an omnichannel business
                in a saturated market, we have to convince the right customers
                that Deer Tulum is a brand that offers a 360 experience.
                It&apos;s for this reason that a strong, predictable, and
                reliable customer experience is vital.
